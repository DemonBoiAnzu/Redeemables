# Redeemables
 A plugin that allows server owners to generate redeem-codes players can use to get items, and other things! Perfect for giveaways.

It is open source, but you may ONLY make changes and PRs to help improve the plugin. do NOT fork it and make your own, and claim it as your own, unless the plugin goes outdated for a long time, and you're updating it, in that case, credit me.
